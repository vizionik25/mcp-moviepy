# Product Definition

## Vision
To create a comprehensive Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that exposes the full capabilities of the `moviepy` library. This server will empower AI agents, developers, and content creators to programmatically generate, edit, and manipulate video content using natural language commands or standardized protocol requests.

## Target Audience
- **AI Agents:** Enabling autonomous systems to generate and modify video content dynamically as part of larger workflows.
- **Developers:** Providing a robust API for automating video production pipelines without deep video processing expertise.
- **Content Creators:** Facilitating quick video creation and editing through accessible CLI or chat interfaces.

## Core Capabilities
The goal is to implement 100% of the `moviepy` package functionalities, including but not limited to:
- **Text-to-Video:** Creating video clips with text overlays, captions, and titles.
- **Editing & Composition:** Concatenation, cutting, merging, and compositing of video and audio clips.
- **Animation:** Programmatic animation of images, shapes, and text.
- **Effects:** Application of video and audio effects, color grading, and transformations.
- **Audio Processing:** Handling audio tracks, mixing, and synchronization with video.

## Reference Documentation
- **Primary Source:** The local `html/` directory containing the full `moviepy` documentation. All implementation details must adhere to the patterns and API specifications found within these documents.
